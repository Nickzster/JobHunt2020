# Data Structures and Algorithms

This is a guide that breaks Data Structures and Algorithms.
This guide is inspired by Cracking the Coding Interview.
Each Data Structure, Algorithm, and Technique is divided into three parts:

- Key Principles
- Key Operations
- Implementation / Example
- Applications / What can they be used for?

The following Data Structures are discussed:

- Arrays & Strings
- Stack
- Queue
- Linked List
- Trees
- Graphs
- Hash Tables

The following Algorithms are discussed:

- DFS
- BFS
- Bidirectional Search
- Greedy Algorithm

**BONUS** Techniques that help solve problems in different ways:

- Recursion
- Dynamic Programming
  - Bottom-Up Algorithm
  - Memoization
  - Half-and-Half
