# Variables

## Typed Languages

- Generally compiled
- Every variable needs to be declared with a type (explicitly defined)
- Types generally include:
  - char
  - int
  - double
  - float
  - boolean

## Untyped languages

- Generally not compiled
- Variables are implicitly defined

Example in Javascript:

```javascript
var variableA = 1;
var variableB = 'Hi!';
var variableC = false;
```

Every variable is defined with the same keyword `var`, but variableA, variableB, and variableC have different types (variableA has type `Number`, variableB has type `String`, and variableC has type `boolean`)
