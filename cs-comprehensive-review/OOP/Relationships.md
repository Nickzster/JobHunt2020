# Relationships

Think about the human experience, and think about all of the relationships you can form with other people. Specifically:

- Think about the relationship you have with your mother
- Think about the relationship you have with your Aunt
- Think about the relationship you have with your boyfriend/husband or girlfriend/wife
- Think about the relationship you have with your best friend
- Think about the relationship you have with a friend
- Think about the relationship you have with a stranger

I know this list is unecessairly long, but it gets the point across: Your relationships are probably unique and different with different people in your life, and you think of them a certain way.

Classes & Objects can also have these relationships. There are three important kinds of relationships in OOP:

- Inheritance (is-a)
- Composition (part-of)
- Aggregation (has-a)
