# Classes VS Objects

- Typically, the `classes` data type represent a schema for an object.
  - Classes can have values & functions (although, they vary language to language in how they work)
- An instantiated class becomes an `object`

(See this website for a good example)[https://www.javatpoint.com/difference-between-object-and-class]

### Some examples

- A **class** _Human_ might be instantiated as a _female_ or _male_ **object**.

- A **class** _vehicle_ (which might be a hierarchy of different classes via inheritance) might be instantiated as a _car_, _truck_, or _plane_ **object**.
